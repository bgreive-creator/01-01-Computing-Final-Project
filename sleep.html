        <h2>Time Spent on Sleep</h2>

        <p>There is considerable variation in the number of hours India and US students spend on sleep, fitness, and screen time. Students in the U.S. get around 6.4 hours of sleep per day while India is at 7.9 hours. Getting an hour and a half more of sleep each night can lead to much greater well being. One reason for this discrepancy is that India spends an hour less on screens than the U.S. does every day. The focus for children in India is getting quality sleep and not technology. This difference highlights how lifestyle priorities influence students’ overall health, focus, and academic performance.</p>

        <h2>Relationship Between Sleep and Social Media</h2>

        <p>The relationship between sleep and social media usage is very messy. In the US there is no clear relationship. It appears that there is no tradeoff between a student's decision to use social media frequently and their sleep quality. Many students are able to use social media quite frequently and still get plenty of sleep. In India, the average student is getting more sleep than in the U.S. This is not attributable to lower social media use, though. In India, they have a similar distribution of social media use with even more extreme outliers at the high end of the distribution.

        <h2>Sleep and Mental Health</h2>

        <p>The treemap allows us to see the differences between men and women in sleep levels and mental health status. Overall, there is a direct relationship between a person’s sleep levels and mental health. In men, it is clear that the more sleep one gets, the better their mental health status. Men who have poor mental health only get 6.4 hours of sleep on average a night. Women do not exhibit as strong of a relationship. Even among those with poor mental health, they are getting above average sleep time. Women with good and excellent mental health are an outlier category that is below the average sleep level.
