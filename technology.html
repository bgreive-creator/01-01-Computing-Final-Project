        <h2>Time Spent on Technology</h2>

        <p>There is considerable variation in the number of hours India and US students spend on sleep, fitness, and screen time. Students in the U.S. spend around 4 hours on screens every day compared to just 2.6 in India. This amount of screen time does not seem to be affecting fitness in the U.S. as the American students are still getting plenty of physical activity. However, the sleep quality of the U.S. students may be suffering due to the elevated screen time, which leads to India students to average 1.5 more hours of sleep that U.S. students.

        <h2>Relationship Between Technology and Sleep</h2>
        <embed src="viz2.html"

        <p>The relationship between sleep and social media usage is very messy. In the US there is no clear relationship. It appears that there is no tradeoff between a student's decision to use social media frequently and their sleep quality. Many students are able to use social media quite frequently and still get plenty of sleep. In India, the average student is getting more sleep than in the U.S. This is not attributable to lower social media use, though. In India, they have a similar distribution of social media use with even more extreme outliers at the high end of the distribution.

        <p>The boxplot is a good visualization for seeing the distribution of screen time between the two countries. The U.S. has a pretty uniform distribution centered around 8 hours and there being an equal number of students on each side of the distribution. Screen time in India is slightly skewed left. They have a much lower median than the U.S. at 3 hours. India also has several outliers while the U.S. has none. While these outliers would not be abnormal for the US, they are more than 4 times the median screen time usage in India.
