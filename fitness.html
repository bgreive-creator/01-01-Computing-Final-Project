        <h2>Time Spent on Fitness</h2>

        <p>There is considerable variation in the number of hours India and US students spend on sleep, fitness, and screen time. The US exercises over 5 times as much as India (5 hours vs 0.75 hours). An explanation for the discrepancy in fitness hours could be due to the prominence of youth sports in the US. India does much better than the U.S. in terms of getting quality sleep, however, they should devote more time to physical activity.</p>

        <h2>Stress and Fitness</h2>
        <embed src="viz3.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>One might expect that the more one exercises, the lower one's stress level. In the data, this is shown to be not true. We actually see the opposite relationship, with those who have high stress actually working out more than those with low stress. It is important to note that the difference in fitness hours is very small between these groups (10-15 minutes on average) so this difference may not be causal but just statistical noise.

        <h2>Fitness and Age</h2>
        <embed src="viz5.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>This graph attempts to explain the difference in physical activity in the U.S. and India, seeing if age may be a correlating factor. The data shows that there is not much variation in fitness hours across age for both countries. Students in the U.S. and India tend to work out for the same amount of time throughout their college years. There is a very slight decline in the U.S. after age twenty which may suggest those in the U.S. become less active as they age.

        <h2>Fitness and Weight Changes</h2>
        <embed src="viz6.html"
          type="text/html" height="700" width="1000" />
        <p>This histogram shows us the percent of people that had a weight change for a given level of physical activity. As the students exercised more, there is a greater likelihood that they lost weight. Conversely, those that spent less than one hour per day on fitness, had the largest likelihood of gaining weight. And among those that exercised one hour per day, around half saw their weight stay constant.
